# General setup + collection of functions needed in methods of vp_calc_functions

### Information
# Viral production can be divided in two phases: Lytic and Lysogenic
# VP replicates represent the lytic viral production, this can be calculated with linear regression (slope) or VIPCAL (average of increments)
# Analoge for VPC samples => they represent both lytic and lysogenic viral production => treatment with antibiotic mitomycin C => selectively inhibits DNA synthesis in bacteria, phages in lysogenic phase can't be measured => Mitomycin C reduces lysogenization => into lytic phase => able to measure
# To determine only the lysogenic viral production: in linear regression VPC_slope - VP_slope, in VIPCAL average of increments of the difference curve
# VIPCAL has his own issues => standard error has big influence => VIPCAL-SE takes this into account and only looks at those increments that don't have overlapping range of SE
# If there is overlap we give a 0 => rather a zero than an uncertain number => VIPCAL-SE is more conservative

# VIPCAL = online tool for estimating lyticaly and lysogenicaly produced viruses
# Lytic VP as the slope between two peaks that occur in viral abundance during incubation, following function holds: VP = [(Vmax1 - Vmin1) + (Vmax2 - Vmin2)] / (Tmax2 - Tmin1) => average over all
# Lysogenic VP computed from difference curve

## 2. Peaks and valleys
# Two main methods will be used for "Viral Production Analyses": Linear Regression vs VIPCAL
# Linear regression calculates the viral production using a slope
# On the other hand, VIPCAL uses average of increments. Therefore, peaks and valleys need to be determined based of the counts

# Determining peaks
peaks <- function(values){
  
  list <- c()

  for (i in 1:(length(values)-1)){ # -1 because we add +10e+10 and -10e+10 to values so that first and last count is not dismissed => if -1 is not presented, last element of list will be NA
    d <- sign(values[i+1] - values[i]) # Determine where the index changes by computing the next count with the current count
    list[length(list)+1] <- d # List with 3 possible values: -1,0,1
    # 0 = no change of count; -1 = counts go down; 1 = counts go up
  }

# If the SE between a peak and valley overlaps, can't guarantee that this difference is sufficient => keep those out
# Only peak of valley if there is a difference and standard errrors don't overlap
# By doing this also the created valley/peak by adding 10e10 and -10e10 is filtered out
# Negative evolution in viral production also filtered out => if you go from peak -> valley (downward) => only increments are kept

## 3. LMER model

  # Solely on replicates column, the model will have problems distinguishing VP and VPC samples: for both rep = 1, 2 or 3
  # In order to make sure the LMER model distinguishes between them, change replicate reference of VPC samples
  # By changing this, an effective separation between both VP and VPC samples are made. 
  # The LMER model can now tike into account the Sample_Type factor but also the interaction between Sample_Type and the new replicate reference
